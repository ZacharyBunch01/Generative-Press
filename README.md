Generative Press - An AI-driven news source

Visit the site here:
https://generativepress.org/

This site queries GNew once every hour and generates articles via ChatGPT's API.  Eventually, I plan on querying Perplexity API to verify and adjust for GPT's accuracy and implicit bias.

I have some future features I would like to include, if users find this site valuable, such as a GP API and an AI YT channel that summarizes the aricles using TTS.

Purposes of this project:
 * To provide a news source that is accurate.
 * To provide articles that contain no implicit biases.
 * To demonstrate a unique use-case of LLMs.

Technologies used:
  * Django
  * GNews
  * ChatGPT API
